## 🧩 Incremental Implementation – Extend Functionality & Cover More Scenarios

You have already:
- Laid the groundwork by scaffolding the solution and defining high-level architecture.
- Implemented a Minimal Viable Implementation (MVI) that satisfies the basic functionality required to pass the initial test suite.

Now proceed to **expand the implementation** to cover additional use cases, edge cases, and deferred features, as described in the blueprint.

### 🎯 Goals of this Phase

- Extend the core logic to handle **all scenarios** described in the user stories and their acceptance criteria.
- Add meaningful logic to improve completeness while maintaining modularity.
- Update or create **new tests** to ensure coverage of extended functionality.

### 🧪 Formal Test Execution – Mandatory

At the end of this phase, you **must run the complete formal test suite**:
- All existing and new tests **must pass**.
- Add tests for any uncovered edge cases.
- Document any remaining limitations or areas needing future refinement.

### ✅ Guidelines

- Maintain alignment with the blueprint’s structure.
- Keep the code production-quality: clear, modular, and documented.
- Refactor as needed to support new logic, but avoid premature optimization.
- Do not yet focus on performance tuning or polishing—prioritize completeness and correctness.

### 🛠️ Your task

1. For each user story:
   - Review the acceptance criteria not yet implemented.
   - Identify edge cases and secondary scenarios.
   - Extend the implementation accordingly.

2. For each new case:
   - Add or update tests.
   - Ensure the verification logic (e.g., test assertions) remains aligned with the blueprint.

3. Run the full test suite and validate all tests pass.

Once this phase is complete and the implementation fully satisfies the blueprint, you can move to code enhancement and optimization if needed.
