# 🧩 Minimum Viable Implementation (MVI) Guide

The goal is to build a **minimum viable implementation** for each user story based on the blueprint, ensuring correctness and testability at every step.

---

## ✅ Scope

- You already have:
  - A structured blueprint with user stories, acceptance criteria, and a plan of action.
  - A scaffolded codebase that makes room for upcoming changes.
  
Now you will build the **simplest working implementation** for each user story that satisfies its requirements and passes all associated tests.

---

## 🔁 Process: One User Story at a Time

### 1. Review the User Story

- Read the user story and its acceptance criteria from the blueprint.

### 2. Write Verification Code

- For each acceptance criterion, write a corresponding automated test (unit or integration).
- Ensure the test clearly reflects the criterion, is easy to run, and produces a reliable outcome.
- The absence of implementation should cause these tests to fail initially.

### 3. Implement the Minimum Logic

- Write the **simplest code** needed to satisfy the user story and make the tests pass.
- Avoid unnecessary generalizations, optimizations, or edge case handling at this stage.
- Stick closely to the logic suggested by the blueprint.

### 4. Run the Full Test Suite

- After implementing each user story, run the **entire test suite**.
- All tests—existing and newly added—must pass.
- Fix any issues immediately before proceeding to the next user story.

### 5. Document and Leave TODOs

- If the blueprint suggests future improvements (e.g. refactoring, edge case handling, performance tuning), add clear TODOs or comments in the code.
- These will be handled in later phases, not during MVI.

## 📌 Principles

- Keep the implementation minimal but correct.
- Build confidence through verification.
- Avoid building more than what’s needed to pass the tests and meet the blueprint requirements.
- Defer enhancements and broader handling to future iterations.

---

## ✅ Final Check

After completing MVI for all user stories:

- Run the test suite again to confirm full functionality.
- Ensure each feature is backed by at least one clear, reliable test.
- Write a summary of what you've accomplished.
