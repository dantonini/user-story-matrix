Adopt the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. The POM approach provides better separation of concerns, improved testability, and easier maintenance for the TUI implementation.
The key changes to the plan include:
- Structured component hierarchy: Organizing the code into components, models, pages, and styles directories
- Independent UI components: Creating standalone searchbox, storylist, and statusbar components
- Centralized state management: Moving UI state into a dedicated model
- Separation of concerns: Dividing presentation, logic, and data management
- Enhanced testability: Each component can now be tested in isolation
- Consistent styling: Styles are centralized in a dedicated package
