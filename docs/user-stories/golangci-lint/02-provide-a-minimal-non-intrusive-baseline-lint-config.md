# Provide a minimal, non-intrusive baseline lint config
As a developer new to static analysis
I want a default golangci-lint configuration with only high-signal linters enabled
so that Iâ€™m not overwhelmed by noise and can start using the tool with confidence.

## Acceptance criteria
- Initial config (.golangci.yml) includes only essential linters: deadcode, errcheck, govet, staticcheck.
- No >10 warnings per file on the initial run.
- Config explained in README or internal doc.
