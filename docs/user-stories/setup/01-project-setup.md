# Initialize USM-CLI Project
The development team needs a CLI tool structure to build upon.

As a developer,  
I want to initialize the usm-cli project structure,  
so that I can start implementing core functionalities.

## Acceptance criteria

- The project follows Go best practices.
- The CLI can be built and executed locally.
- A repository is set up on GitHub with proper version control.
- The CLI has a basic command (`usm --help`) that displays usage information.
