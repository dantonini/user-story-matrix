# Package and Distribute USM-CLI
The CLI should be distributed in an accessible way.

As a developer,  
I want to package and distribute usm-cli,  
so that users can install it easily.

## Acceptance criteria

- The CLI is compiled into standalone binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- The installation scripts reference the latest stable version.
