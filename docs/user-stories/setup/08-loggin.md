# Implement Logging and Debugging Support
Developers need to see logs and debug issues easily.

As a developer,  
I want logging and debugging support,  
so that I can troubleshoot issues efficiently.

## Acceptance criteria

- The CLI uses a logging library (`log` or `zap`).
- The CLI provides a `--debug` flag for verbose output.
- Errors include clear messages with possible solutions.
- Logs can be written to a file for troubleshooting.
