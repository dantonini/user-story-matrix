# Package and Distribute USM-CLI
Users should be able to install the CLI easily.

As a developer,  
I want to package and distribute usm-cli,  
so that users can install it easily.

## Acceptance criteria

- The CLI is compiled into standalone binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- The latest release is published on GitHub Releases.
- A versioning system is established (e.g., Semantic Versioning).
- A release process is documented in `RELEASE.md`.
