# Entering Search Mode Separates Typing from Selection

**User Story**  
As a CLI user,  
I want the interface to distinguish between typing in the search bar and selecting from the list,  
so that I can type full queries (including spaces) without triggering selection.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Typing enters "search input mode"
- In search mode:
  - `space` inserts a space character
  - `Enter` or `Esc` exits typing mode and returns focus to list
- Only when focus is in the list does `space` toggle item selection
- Visual cue: cursor visible in search bar, e.g.
