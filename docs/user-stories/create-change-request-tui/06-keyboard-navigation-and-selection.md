## 6. Keyboard Navigation and Selection

**User Story**  
As a CLI user,  
I want to navigate and select multiple user stories with the keyboard,  
so that I can efficiently build a change request.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Use ↑/↓ to navigate list items
- `space` toggles selection when list is focused
- `enter` confirms selection and exits
- Selected items show `[✓]`
