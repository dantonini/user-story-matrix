## 8. Scrolling and Large Lists

**User Story**  
As a CLI user,  
I want to scroll or paginate through large story lists,  
so that I can view and access all items even if they don't fit on screen.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- List supports:
  - Arrow key scroll
  - PageUp/PageDown for faster navigation
- UI shows current visible range:
	```
	Stories 21–40 / 100 | ↑↓ scroll | PgUp/PgDn fast scroll
	```
