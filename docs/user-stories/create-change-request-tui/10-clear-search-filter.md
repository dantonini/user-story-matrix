## 10. Clear Search Filter

**User Story**  
As a CLI user,  
I want to clear the current search query with a simple action,  
so that I can return to the full list without restarting.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Pressing `Esc` in search mode:
  - Clears the current query
  - Refreshes story list to unfiltered view
