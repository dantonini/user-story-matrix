# Auto-Focus First Result After Search

**User Story**  
As a CLI user,  
I want the first matching story to be focused after a search,  
so that I can immediately select it without extra steps.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- After search (and returning to list focus), the first result is highlighted
- User can immediately select or move with keyboard
