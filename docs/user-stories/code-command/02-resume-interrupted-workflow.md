# Resume interrupted workflow  
As a  
developer using USM,  
I want  
the `code` command to resume from where it left off using the `.step` file,  
So that  
I donâ€™t lose progress if the workflow was interrupted.

### Acceptance Criteria
- If the `.step` file exists, the command uses it to determine the next step.
- If the `.step` file does not exist, the command starts from the first step.
- The `.step` file is updated only after successful completion of a step.
