# Handle multiple workflows in parallel  
As a  
developer working on several change requests,  
I want  
each change request file to maintain its own independent state,  
So that  
I can switch between them without losing track of progress.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The `.step` file is created per input file.
- No cross-contamination occurs between different workflows.
- Invoking the command with different change request files does not interfere with each otherâ€™s step progress.
