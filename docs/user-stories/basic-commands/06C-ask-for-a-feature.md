# Interactive Input Navigation
As a user
I want to be able to navigate between input fields easily
So that I can edit and review my responses before submission

## Acceptance Criteria
- Pressing Enter confirms the current field and moves to the next one.
- Pressing Tab also moves to the next field.
- Pressing Shift+Tab moves to the previous field.
- The cursor should allow seamless editing of previously entered fields before final confirmation.
- When an empty field is confirmed, a summary should be displayed automatically, prompting the user to submit the request.
