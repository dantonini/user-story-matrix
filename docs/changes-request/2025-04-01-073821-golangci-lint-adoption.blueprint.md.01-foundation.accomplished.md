# Foundation Phase Accomplishments - golangci-lint adoption

This document outlines the key accomplishments in the foundation phase of integrating golangci-lint into the USM project. The changes provide the necessary structure and scaffolding for the full implementation of the linting functionality.

## Architectural Components

### Core Lint Package
- Created `internal/lint/lint.go` with core abstractions for linting functionality
- Defined the `Config` struct for flexible linting configuration
- Implemented preset configurations: `DefaultConfig()`, `FastConfig()`, `DeadCodeConfig()`
- Added the `Run()` function that handles executing golangci-lint with appropriate arguments
- Implemented utility functions like `IsInstalled()` and `Install()` for dependency management

### Configuration
- Added `.golangci.yml` with minimal, non-intrusive default settings
- Configured the four required linters: deadcode, errcheck, govet, staticcheck
- Set up appropriate excludes for test files and generated code
- Added reasonable timeouts and output configuration

### Build System Integration
- Updated `Makefile` to include three new targets:
  - `lint`: Runs linters only
  - `build-full`: Runs linters followed by build
  - `lint-fix-deadcode`: Helper for detecting and removing dead code
- Added `install-hooks` target for pre-commit hook installation
- Modified existing targets to maintain backward compatibility

### CI/CD Pipeline Updates
- Enhanced `.github/workflows/build.yml` with three distinct jobs:
  - `lint`: Runs only linting checks
  - `build`: Standard build without linting (existing)
  - `build-full`: Complete build with linting
- Configured job dependencies to ensure proper workflow

### Pre-commit Hook
- Created `hooks/pre-commit` script for lightweight linting
- Configured it to only check modified files
- Ensured non-blocking behavior for developer workflow
- Set up fast linter subset with appropriate timeouts

### Dead Code Management
- Added `scripts/lint-fix-deadcode.sh` to identify and remove dead code
- Implemented backup functionality to prevent data loss
- Added interactive mode for safer operation
- Integrated with `lint-fix-deadcode` make target

### Dependency Management
- Created `tools.go` to track and version golangci-lint dependency
- Added auto-installation capabilities in scripts and targets
- Standardized on golangci-lint v1.54.2

## Testing Framework
- Added basic tests in `internal/lint/lint_test.go`
- Implemented configuration validation tests
- Added command availability checks
- Created tests that gracefully handle missing dependencies

## Documentation
- Updated `README.md` with a comprehensive "Code Quality" section
- Documented all available linters
- Provided clear usage instructions for different lint commands
- Added information about pre-commit hook installation and usage
- Explained configuration options and customization

## Code References and Test Coverage

### Core Implementation
- `internal/lint/lint.go:Run()`: Primary function for executing linting commands
- `internal/lint/lint.go:Config`: Main data structure for lint configuration
- `internal/lint/lint_test.go:TestLintConfigExists()`: Validates configuration existence
- `internal/lint/lint_test.go:TestLintCommandWorks()`: Verifies lint command functionality

### Build and CI Integration
- `Makefile:lint`: Target for linting code without building
- `Makefile:build-full`: Target combining linting and building
- `.github/workflows/build.yml:lint`: CI job for linting
- `.github/workflows/build.yml:build-full`: CI job for full build with linting

### Pre-commit and Dead Code Handling
- `hooks/pre-commit`: Lightweight linting before commits
- `scripts/lint-fix-deadcode.sh`: Specialized script for dead code removal
- `Makefile:install-hooks`: Hook installation mechanism
- `Makefile:lint-fix-deadcode`: Dead code removal target

## Blind Spots and Areas for Further Development

- No test coverage yet for actual execution of linting with different parameters
- Integration tests needed for CI workflow validation
- Need to add explicit tests for the pre-commit hook functionality
- Missing automated tests for the dead code removal script
- The `tools.go` dependency tracking needs module version verification tests

## Acceptance Criteria Status

### User Story 1: Integrate golangci-lint in the CI/CD pipeline with optional usage
- ✅ Makefile targets created: build (no lint), build-full (includes lint), lint (lint only)
- ✅ CI pipeline configured for all three modes
- ⚠️ Need to verify CI behavior with actual runs

### User Story 2: Provide a minimal, non-intrusive baseline lint config
- ✅ Initial config (.golangci.yml) created with essential linters
- ✅ README updated with configuration documentation
- ⚠️ Need to verify <10 warnings per file on initial run

### User Story 3: Run dead code detection automatically in full builds
- ✅ Dead code linter enabled in .golangci.yml
- ✅ Dead code detection integrated with build-full
- ✅ Auto-removal script created with backup functionality
- ⚠️ Need to test with actual dead code scenarios

### User Story 4: Pre-commit hook to warn on obvious issues without blocking
- ✅ Hook created to run fast linter subset
- ✅ Non-blocking behavior implemented
- ✅ Installation mechanism added
- ⚠️ Need to test with actual commits

## Design Decision Changes

The original blueprint proposed a simpler approach to dead code removal, but the implementation has been enhanced to include:

1. Automatic backup of files before making changes
2. Interactive mode to confirm changes
3. More verbose output with colorization for better usability

These changes provide a safer, more user-friendly workflow while still meeting the original requirements.
