Read a set of user stories using the command: ./cat-user-stories-in-change-request.sh docs/changes-request/2025-03-26-020055-code-command.blueprint.md

You have already:
- Laid the foundation (project structure, placeholders, key abstractions)
- Completed the Minimum Viable Implementation (MVI) to satisfy core acceptance criteria
- Extended the implementation to support more scenarios and edge cases

Now, execute the last phase of the iteration: **Refinement & Stabilization**.

### üéØ Objectives:
- Refine the codebase for clarity, maintainability, and performance
- Enhance test coverage to simulate real-world usage
- Ensure robustness through thorough validation
- Finalize the iteration by producing production-quality code and test suites

---

### üß© Tasks to Perform:

1. **Refactor for Maintainability:**
   - Improve naming, structure, and modularity
   - Remove duplication, unused code, and reduce complexity
   - Ensure clear separation of concerns and adherence to clean code principles

2. **Optimize for Performance (if applicable):**
   - Profile critical paths
   - Optimize data structures and algorithms for efficiency
   - Avoid premature optimization ‚Äî focus on known bottlenecks or risky parts

3. **Enhance Test Coverage:**
   - Add tests that simulate real-world edge cases and usage patterns
   - Ensure each user story and its acceptance criteria are covered
   - Include tests for:
     - Error handling and invalid inputs
     - Performance-sensitive areas
     - Integration between components

4. **Stabilize the Codebase:**
   - Resolve any known issues or inconsistencies
   - Finalize API boundaries and expected behaviors
   - Ensure the implementation is resilient and ready for review or release

---

### ‚úÖ Mandatory Before Completion:

- **Ensure 100% coverage** of acceptance criteria from the blueprint
- **Perform a final code review** with an eye on polish and stability
- **Document any deviations** from the blueprint and rationale for changes

---

### üìù Output Requirements:

- Final version of the code with inline comments
- Updated and complete test suite
- An accomplishment report in docs/changes-request/2025-03-26-020055-code-command.code.md.04-refinement.accomplished.md

The accomplishment report is not a summary, it is a "compass" to the changes you made, hence avoid general statements/claim, be precise:
Use always short code references (no code at all, 
 just a compact/understable reference to lookup for, do not use line numbers) 
 as foundation of your statements
 For example:
 - Instead of "Added tests for ..." / "Updated tests for ... " show me which test case has been added (using code references)
 - Instead of "Message templates are now centralized with clear naming conventions" show me where to find them (using code references)
 - Include a section of "blind spot" if any: leverage test coverage report to reinforce your statements
 - Include a dedicated section for potentially still not yet well implemented acceptance criteria.
 - Include any changes to original design decisions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Reminder:
Do not introduce new features at this stage. Focus only on refining and stabilizing the existing work to make it reliable and production-ready.

Proceed with the **Refinement & Stabilization** phase now.
