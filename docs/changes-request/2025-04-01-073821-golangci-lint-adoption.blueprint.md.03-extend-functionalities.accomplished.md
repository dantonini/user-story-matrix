# Accomplishment Report: golangci-lint Adoption

## Core Implementation
- Extended the core linting functionality in `internal/lint/lint.go` with multiple specialized configuration types:
  - `DefaultConfig()`: Base configuration with standard linters
  - `FastConfig()`: Optimized for pre-commit hooks
  - `CIConfig()`: Specific settings for CI environments
  - `TestConfig()`: Focused on test files only
  - `DeadCodeConfig()`: Specialized for dead code detection

- Enhanced the `Run()` function in `internal/lint/lint.go` with comprehensive argument handling:
  - Support for custom timeout configuration
  - Caching capabilities
  - Output format specification
  - Path filtering

## Testing Infrastructure
- Implemented resilient tests that handle linter deprecation warnings:
  - `TestDeadcodeLinterDeprecationHandling`: Verifies deprecated linter handling
  - `TestBuildFullContainsAlternativesToDeadcode`: Ensures build process works regardless of linter deprecation

- Created robust Makefile integration tests:
  - `TestLintCommand`: Verifies basic lint command functionality
  - `TestBuildFullCommand`: Tests combined linting and building flow
  - `TestLintTestsTarget`: Specialized linting for test files only
  - `TestLintCITarget`: Checks CI-optimized linting configuration
  - `TestLintReportTarget`: Validates report generation

## Version Compatibility
- Added version-aware functionality across several areas:
  - `GetLintVersion()`: Extracts installed golangci-lint version
  - Makefile `GOLANGCI_VERSION` and `SUPPORTS_CACHE` variables
  - `lint-fix-deadcode.sh`: Automatically selects appropriate linter based on version

## GitHub Actions Integration
- Set up dedicated CI linting workflow in `.github/workflows/build.yml`:
  - Distinct `lint` job with report artifact generation
  - `test-lint` job specifically for test files
  - `build-full` job combining linting and building

## Developer Experience
- Created accessible developer tooling:
  - Pre-commit hook (`hooks/pre-commit`) for lightweight, non-blocking linting
  - Dead code detection script (`scripts/lint-fix-deadcode.sh`) with backup capability
  - Specialized Makefile targets for different linting scenarios

## Config Structure
- Established a standardized `.golangci.yml` configuration:
  - Selective linter enablement through `disable-all: true`
  - Required linters: `deadcode`, `errcheck`, `govet`, `staticcheck`
  - Documented linters with deprecation notice for `deadcode`
  - Configured version compatibility notes for future maintenance

## Blind Spots
- The tests expect specific target names in the Makefile - any renaming would require test updates
- `TestLintCommand` and other test functions expect certain output patterns that might change with golangci-lint updates
- The `lint-fix-deadcode.sh` script relies on specific patterns in golangci-lint output for parsing unused elements

## Acceptance Criteria Not Fully Covered
- The current implementation still uses `deadcode` rather than fully migrating to `unused` linter
- Test coverage for edge cases like extremely large projects might need enhancement
- Command timeout handling could be improved for very large codebases
