## 🔄 Final Iteration Phase: Refinement & Stabilization

You have already:
- ✅ Laid the foundation (project structure, placeholders, key abstractions)
- ✅ Completed the Minimum Viable Implementation (MVI) to satisfy core acceptance criteria
- ✅ Extended the implementation to support more scenarios and edge cases

Now, execute the **Refinement & Stabilization** phase to complete the iteration.

### 🎯 Objectives:
- Refine the codebase for clarity, maintainability, and performance
- Enhance test coverage to simulate real-world usage
- Ensure robustness through thorough validation
- Finalize the iteration by producing production-quality code and test suites

---

### 🧩 Tasks to Perform:

1. **Refactor for Maintainability:**
   - Improve naming, structure, and modularity
   - Remove duplication, unused code, and reduce complexity
   - Ensure clear separation of concerns and adherence to clean code principles

2. **Optimize for Performance (if applicable):**
   - Profile critical paths
   - Optimize data structures and algorithms for efficiency
   - Avoid premature optimization — focus on known bottlenecks or risky parts

3. **Enhance Test Coverage:**
   - Add tests that simulate real-world edge cases and usage patterns
   - Ensure each user story and its acceptance criteria are covered
   - Include tests for:
     - Error handling and invalid inputs
     - Performance-sensitive areas
     - Integration between components

4. **Stabilize the Codebase:**
   - Resolve any known issues or inconsistencies
   - Finalize API boundaries and expected behaviors
   - Ensure the implementation is resilient and ready for review or release

---

### ✅ Mandatory Before Completion:

- [ ] **Run the full formal test suite** – All tests must pass
- [ ] **Ensure 100% coverage** of acceptance criteria from the blueprint
- [ ] **Perform a final code review** (self or pair-based) with an eye on polish and stability
- [ ] **Document any deviations** from the blueprint and rationale for changes

---

### 📝 Output Requirements:

- Final version of the code with inline comments
- Updated and complete test suite
- Brief changelog summarizing:
  - Key refinements made
  - Test improvements
  - Any changes to original design decisions

---

### ⚠️ Reminder:
Do not introduce new features at this stage. Focus only on refining and stabilizing the existing work to make it reliable and production-ready.

Proceed with the **Refinement & Stabilization** phase now.
