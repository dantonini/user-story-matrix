# Enhanced Create Change Request Implementation

## Summary
This implementation enhances the testability and functionality of the `create change-request` command by introducing proper abstractions for testing and enriching the user story data model to support better filtering and content extraction. The changes enable more sophisticated story selection during change request creation.

## Key Changes and Abstractions

### Search Engine Implementation
Added a new search engine in `internal/search/engine.go` that provides sophisticated filtering and search capabilities:

- **State Management**:
  - `FilterState` tracks current search query, show/hide implemented stories, and result counts
  - Thread-safe state updates with mutex protection
  - Maintains total and filtered story counts

- **Caching System**:
  - Implemented `SearchCache` for performance optimization
  - Caches implementation status and search results
  - Thread-safe cache with read/write locks
  - Automatic cache invalidation based on timestamps

- **Search Features**:
  - Fuzzy text search across story fields with weighted scoring:
    - Title (highest weight)
    - Description (medium weight)
    - Acceptance criteria (lower weight)
  - Implementation status filtering
  - Combined filtering (text search + implementation status)
  - Search result scoring and ranking

- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Pre-allocation of slices for better memory usage
  - Efficient string concatenation for search
  - Smart caching of frequently accessed results

### Implementation Status Tracking
Added a new package `internal/implementation` to handle tracking which user stories are implemented:

- **IsUserStoryImplemented Function**:
  - Checks if a user story is referenced by any implemented change request
  - Scans change request directory for blueprint files that have matching implementation files
  - Verifies if the user story is referenced in these implemented change requests

- **UpdateImplementationStatus Function**:
  - Updates the `IsImplemented` flag on a user story based on implementation status
  - Called during user story loading to automatically set correct implementation status

- **Integration with User Story Loading**:
  - `LoadUserStoryFromFile` is now linked to the implementation tracking system
  - Implementation status is determined dynamically rather than stored statically
  - A user story is considered implemented if it's referenced by a change request that has a corresponding `.implementation.md` file

### Program Abstraction
Created a new abstraction layer for the Bubble Tea program to enable testing without terminal interaction:

- Introduced a `program` interface that abstracts the Bubble Tea program behavior
- Implemented a `teaProgram` wrapper around the real `tea.Program` 
- Added a `programCreator` function type for dependency injection
- Set up a default implementation that uses the real Bubble Tea program in production

This abstraction allows us to substitute a mock implementation during testing that doesn't attempt to take over the terminal, preventing test hangs.

### Enhanced User Story Model
Significantly improved the `UserStory` struct in `models/user_story.go` to support richer content and filtering:

- Added `Description` field to store the story's detailed description
- Added `Criteria` field as a string slice to store acceptance criteria
- Added `IsImplemented` flag to track implementation status
- Added `MatchScore` field to support search relevance ranking
- Improved metadata handling and content parsing

These enhancements enable better filtering and organization of user stories during change request creation.

### User Story Template and Parsing
Enhanced the user story template generation and parsing:

- Improved template structure with clearer sections for user story format
- Enhanced metadata handling with proper timestamps and content hashing
- Added robust parsing for:
  - Story descriptions (between title and first ## heading)
  - Acceptance criteria (bullet points)
  - Implementation status
- Better filename generation with sequential numbering

### Filtering Capabilities
Added comprehensive filtering support:

- Introduced `showAll` flag to control visibility of implemented stories
- Added filtering infrastructure in the selection UI
- Enabled filtering by:
  - Implementation status
  - Content matching
  - Story metadata

### Selection UI Mockability
Updated the Selection UI to make it testable:

- Added a function type `NewSelectionUIFunc` in the UI package
- Implemented a default version that creates a real selection UI
- Added a variable `CurrentNewSelectionUI` that can be swapped in tests
- Made the create command use this variable instead of directly instantiating the UI

### Terminal IO Abstraction
Enhanced the terminal IO abstractions:

- Used interfaces for terminal input/output operations
- Implemented a mockable IO provider for testing
- Used dependency injection to allow tests to provide mock implementations

## Test Implementation
Enhanced the test suite with complete test coverage for the create command:

- Created test cases for successful creation, invalid directory, empty directory, and duplicate name scenarios
- Implemented a `mockProgram` that returns the model without running a real terminal UI
- Set up a mock selection UI that returns predetermined selected stories
- Used a mock terminal IO to simulate user input for the change request name
- Added a dedicated `TestImplementationStatusFilter` test that specifically verifies the filter acceptance criteria
- Added test coverage for implementation status detection in `internal/implementation/tracker_test.go`

## Implementation Status Filter Testing
Added comprehensive test coverage for the Implementation Status Filter acceptance criteria:

- Created `TestImplementationStatusFilter` function in `cmd/create_test.go` that specifically tests:
  - Default behavior (only showing unimplemented stories)
  - `--show-all` flag behavior (showing all stories regardless of implementation status)
- Implemented test verification by capturing the `showAll` flag value passed to the UI
- Used dependency injection to replace real components with testable mocks:
  - Mocked the UI selection component to capture filter parameters
  - Mocked the Bubble Tea program to prevent terminal takeover
  - Mocked the file system to provide test data
  - Mocked terminal IO to simulate user input
- Ensured tests can run in isolation and without flakiness
- Verified both positive and negative test cases

## Implementation Status Detection Testing
Added tests to specifically verify that a user story is properly marked as implemented when referenced by a change request with an implementation file:

- Created `TestIsUserStoryImplemented` in `internal/implementation/tracker_test.go` that verifies:
  - A user story is not marked as implemented initially
  - Adding an implementation file for a change request correctly identifies the story as implemented
  - The `UpdateImplementationStatus` function properly updates the `IsImplemented` flag
- Test covers the complete workflow for implementation status detection
- Ensures change requests reference detection works correctly

## Benefits

1. **Isolated Testing**: Tests no longer interact with the actual terminal, eliminating hanging tests and making them more reliable
2. **Reproducible Results**: Test results are deterministic since we're controlling all external interactions
3. **Faster Test Execution**: Tests run much faster because they don't wait for terminal interaction
4. **Better Test Coverage**: We can now test edge cases and error scenarios that were difficult to test before
5. **Improved User Experience**: Better filtering and content organization makes story selection more efficient
6. **Richer Data Model**: Enhanced user story model enables more sophisticated features and integrations
7. **Verified Acceptance Criteria**: Each acceptance criterion is now covered by targeted tests
8. **Dynamic Implementation Status**: User stories now correctly reflect their implementation status based on existing implementation files

## Files Updated

- `cmd/create.go`: Added program interface, dependency injection, and filtering support
- `cmd/create_test.go`: Created proper test cases with mocking, including dedicated tests for implementation status filtering
- `internal/ui/selection.go`: Made the selection UI creation mockable
- `internal/io`: Leveraged existing terminal IO mocking capabilities
- `internal/models/user_story.go`: Enhanced user story model and parsing capabilities
- `internal/search/engine.go`: Implemented the search and filtering engine
- `internal/implementation/tracker.go`: Added implementation status detection
- `internal/implementation/tracker_test.go`: Added tests for implementation status detection

## Test Scenarios

Added comprehensive test scenarios in `cmd/create_test.go`:

1. **Successful Create**: Tests the happy path of creating a change request
2. **Invalid Directory**: Tests handling of a non-existent source directory
3. **Empty Directory**: Tests handling of a directory with no user stories
4. **Duplicate Name**: Tests proper error handling when a change request with the same name already exists
5. **Implementation Status Filter**: Tests the filtering of user stories based on implementation status:
   - Default behavior only shows unimplemented stories
   - `--show-all` flag shows all stories regardless of implementation status
6. **Implementation Status Detection**: Tests that a user story is correctly marked as implemented when:
   - It is referenced by a change request
   - That change request has a corresponding implementation file

Each test verifies both the error messages and success messages to ensure proper handling of all scenarios.
