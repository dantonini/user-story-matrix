# MVI Accomplishment Report - Introduce Prompt in Step Definition

This report documents the completion of the Minimum Viable Implementation (MVI) for introducing a prompt field in the step definition.

## Summary

The MVI requirements for this user story were fully implemented during the foundation phase. The prompt field was added to the WorkflowStep structure, variable interpolation was implemented to support the `change_request_file_path` variable, and the design was made extensible to support additional variables in the future.

## User Story Implementation

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

1. ✅ **The step definition now includes a new prompt attribute.**
   - **Implementation**: The `Prompt` field was added to the `WorkflowStep` struct in `internal/workflow/workflow.go`.
   - **Test Reference**: `TestWorkflowStepStructure` in `internal/workflow/prompt_test.go` verifies that the `Prompt` field exists and can be set/retrieved.

2. ✅ **The prompt supports variable interpolation with the `change_request_file_path` variable.**
   - **Implementation**: The `InterpolatePrompt` function in `internal/workflow/prompt.go` implements variable replacement.
   - **Test Reference**: `TestInterpolatePrompt` in `internal/workflow/prompt_test.go` verifies that `${change_request_file_path}` is correctly replaced with the actual path.
   - **Test Reference**: `TestGenerateStepPrompt` in `internal/workflow/prompt_test.go` verifies that the prompt is correctly processed with the path variable.
   - **Test Reference**: `TestStepExecutor_ExecuteStep` in `internal/workflow/executor_test.go` includes validation for prompt interpolation in the step execution context.

3. ✅ **The implementation is designed to be extendable for additional variables.**
   - **Implementation**: The `PromptVariables` struct in `internal/workflow/prompt.go` is designed to be extended with additional fields.
   - **Implementation**: The `InterpolatePromptWithMissingVars` function identifies missing variables to support future validation.
   - **Implementation**: The `interpolatePromptWithMap` function allows for custom variable mappings beyond the base structure.
   - **Test Reference**: `TestInterpolatePromptWithMap` in `internal/workflow/prompt_test.go` demonstrates extensibility by using a custom variable mapping.
   - **Test Reference**: `TestInterpolatePromptWithMissingVars` in `internal/workflow/prompt_test.go` verifies the ability to identify unknown variables for future validation.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Prompt Field Usage

The prompt field has been successfully integrated into the workflow system:

- All standard workflow steps now include meaningful default prompts with variable interpolation.
- The `ExecuteStep` function in `internal/workflow/executor.go` processes the prompt with variable interpolation.
- The generated content includes the interpolated prompt in the output.
- A default prompt is generated when the prompt field is empty, ensuring backward compatibility.

### 2. Variable Interpolation

The variable interpolation system works as follows:

- Simple string replacement for the core variable `change_request_file_path`.
- Regex-based variable extraction for identifying all variables in a prompt.
- Support for detecting missing or unknown variables.
- Custom variable mapping for extended variable sets.

### 3. Extensibility Design

The system has been designed for extensibility:

- The `PromptVariables` struct can be extended with additional fields.
- The interpolation functions can handle arbitrary variables.
- The system can identify and report unknown variables.
- Custom variable mappings are supported through the `interpolatePromptWithMap` function.

## What Was Tested

The following tests were implemented to verify the functionality:

1. **`TestWorkflowStepStructure`**: Verifies that the `WorkflowStep` struct includes the `Prompt` field.
2. **`TestInterpolatePrompt`**: Tests basic variable interpolation with the `change_request_file_path` variable.
3. **`TestInterpolatePromptWithMissingVars`**: Tests handling of missing variables, ensuring they are identified but don't break the interpolation.
4. **`TestInterpolatePromptWithMap`**: Tests extensibility by using a custom variable mapping.
5. **`TestGenerateStepPrompt`**: Tests the generation of prompts for workflow steps, including default prompt generation.
6. **`TestGenerateDefaultPrompt`**: Tests the generation of default prompts based on step descriptions.
7. **`TestStepExecutor_ExecuteStep`**: Includes validation for the prompt field in the step execution context.

## Test Coverage

The overall test coverage for the workflow package is excellent at 93.1% of statements. For the prompt-related functionality specifically, we have achieved 100% test coverage:

| File | Function | Coverage |
|------|----------|----------|
| prompt.go | InterpolatePrompt | 100.0% |
| prompt.go | InterpolatePromptWithMissingVars | 100.0% |
| prompt.go | interpolatePromptWithMap | 100.0% |
| prompt.go | generateStepPrompt | 100.0% |
| prompt.go | generateDefaultPrompt | 100.0% |

This comprehensive test coverage ensures that all aspects of the prompt functionality are properly verified, providing confidence in the robustness of the implementation.

## Conclusion

The Minimum Viable Implementation (MVI) for the prompt field in step definitions has been successfully completed. All acceptance criteria have been met, and comprehensive tests have been implemented to verify the functionality. The implementation is clean, focused, and follows Go idioms.

The prompt field provides a way to include actionable instructions for AI agents in workflow steps, with support for variable interpolation. The system is designed to be extensible, allowing for additional variables to be added in the future without changes to the core interpolation mechanism.
