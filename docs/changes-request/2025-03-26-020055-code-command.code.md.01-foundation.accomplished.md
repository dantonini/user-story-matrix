# Code Command Implementation - Foundation Phase Accomplishments

## Overview
We have successfully implemented the foundation for the `code` command, which provides a structured approach to implementing change requests through a predefined workflow. This lays the groundwork for AI-assisted development with controlled, repeatable steps.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Architecture & Design
- Created new package `internal/workflow` for managing workflow state and step tracking
- Implemented a modular design that separates concerns and allows for future extensions
- Established a clear structure for the 8-step implementation workflow:
  1. Laying the foundation
  2. Laying the foundation testing
  3. Minimum Viable Implementation (MVI)
  4. MVI testing
  5. Extending functionalities
  6. Extending functionalities testing
  7. Final iteration
  8. Final iteration testing

### 2. Core Functionality
- Implemented state management through `.step` file tracking
- Added workflow reset capability with `--reset` flag
- Created proper abstractions for file system operations
- Established clean separation of terminal I/O concerns

### 3. Testing & Quality
- Achieved 86.8% test coverage for the workflow package
- Implemented comprehensive unit tests
- Created proper abstractions for testability
- Followed best practices for IO handling in tests

### 4. Documentation
- Updated main README with command usage and examples
- Added clear documentation about the proof-of-concept status
- Included examples for creating and implementing change requests

## Current Status
The foundation phase has successfully established the core infrastructure needed to support all user stories from the blueprint. The `code` command is currently in a proof-of-concept state, with:

- ✅ Workflow state management
- ✅ Step tracking
- ✅ Basic command structure
- ✅ File system interactions
- ✅ High test coverage

## Next Steps
The next phase will focus on implementing the actual step execution logic in the `executeStep` function, which will include:

- Generating appropriate prompts for each step
- Executing AI-assisted tasks
- Handling specific logic for each step type
- Expanding AI integration capabilities

The modular design we've established will make it straightforward to implement these features while maintaining code quality and testability.
