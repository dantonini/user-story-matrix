# Basic Commands Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of three core CLI commands in the User Story Matrix (USM) project:
1. `add user-story` - For adding new user stories
2. `list user-stories` - For listing existing user stories
3. `create change-request` - For creating change requests from existing user stories

## Implementation Details

### Project Structure

The implementation followed a well-structured approach:

```
usm/
├── cmd/
│   ├── add.go        # Implementation of the add user-story command
│   ├── list.go       # Implementation of the list user-stories command
│   ├── create.go     # Implementation of the create change-request command
│   └── root.go       # Base CLI setup
├── internal/
│   ├── io/
│   │   ├── file_system.go       # Filesystem abstraction for testability
│   │   ├── mock_file_system.go  # Mock implementation for testing
│   │   ├── prompt.go            # User input/output interfaces
│   │   └── mock_prompt.go       # Mock I/O for testing
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── user_story.go        # User story data model
│   │   └── change_request.go    # Change request data model
│   └── utils/
│       └── formatter.go         # Formatting utilities for CLI output
```

### Key Dependencies

The implementation leveraged several high-quality Go libraries:

- **github.com/spf13/viper** - For configuration management
- **github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss** - For terminal styling
- **github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles** - For interactive terminal UI components
- **github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea** - The underlying TUI framework

### Design Patterns

Several design patterns were employed to ensure maintainability and testability:

1. **Dependency Injection**:
   - File system operations were abstracted behind interfaces
   - User I/O was abstracted for easy mocking in tests

2. **Interface Segregation**:
   - Separate interfaces for file operations and user interactions

3. **Model-View Separation**:
   - Data models separate from presentation logic
   - Formatting utilities for consistent display

### Command Implementations

#### Add User Story Command

The `add user-story` command:
- Accepts an optional `--into` flag to specify target directory
- Prompts for user story title
- Generates a sequential number for the filename
- Creates a markdown template with metadata
- Provides success/error feedback

#### List User Stories Command

The `list user-stories` command:
- Accepts an optional `--from` flag to specify source directory
- Walks the directory tree to find all user stories
- Parses each user story from its markdown file
- Displays a formatted table of all stories
- Shows a summary count

#### Create Change Request Command

The `create change-request` command:
- Accepts an optional `--from` flag to specify source directory
- Lists available user stories
- Provides an interactive multi-selection interface
- Prompts for the change request name
- Creates a change request file with references to selected user stories
- Provides a prompt instruction for AI assistants

### Testing Strategy

Tests were implemented for all components:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Mock file system for testing file operations
   - Mock I/O for testing user interactions

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Tests for command execution with mock dependencies

### Documentation

The README was updated with:
- Instructions for each command
- Examples of usage
- Explanation of project structure

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the future:

1. Add support for editing existing user stories
2. Implement validation for user story content
3. Add version control integration
4. Support custom templates for user stories and change requests
5. Add tracking of change request status
6. Implement search functionality

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully met all the acceptance criteria defined in the user stories:

1. The CLI now has commands to add user stories, list user stories, and create change requests
2. All commands accept directory flags as specified
3. User prompts collect the required information
4. Files are created with proper formatting and in the correct locations
5. Success/error messages are displayed appropriately

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the User Story Matrix CLI tool, with well-structured code that will be easy to maintain and extend in the future.
