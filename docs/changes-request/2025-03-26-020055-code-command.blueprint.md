# Blueprint

## Overview

The `code` command aims to provide a structured, incremental approach to implementing change requests by dividing the implementation process into predefined steps. It enables developers to progress methodically through a workflow, maintain state between sessions, handle multiple change requests in parallel, and gracefully recover from errors or interruptions. The command follows a predefined sequence of steps, tracks progress in a persistent state file, and provides clear feedback at each stage of the process.

The command will guide developers through a consistent 8-step process for each change request, ensuring that each phase (foundation, MVI, extended functionality, and final iteration) includes both implementation and test verification stages. By persisting the workflow state, developers can safely interrupt and resume their work without losing progress or context.

## Fundamentals

### Data Structures

1. **WorkflowStep**
   - Purpose: Represents a single step in the implementation workflow
   - Structure:
     ```
     type WorkflowStep struct {
         ID          string // Unique identifier (e.g., "01-laying-the-foundation")
         Description string // Human-readable description
         IsTest      bool   // Whether this is a test step
         OutputFile  string // Template for output filename
     }
     ```

2. **WorkflowState**
   - Purpose: Tracks the current state of a workflow for a specific change request
   - Structure:
     ```
     type WorkflowState struct {
         ChangeRequestPath string       // Path to the change request file
         CurrentStepIndex  int          // Index of the current step (0-based)
         LastModified      time.Time    // When the state was last updated
         CompletedSteps    []string     // List of completed step IDs
     }
     ```

3. **WorkflowDefinition**
   - Purpose: Defines the full sequence of steps in the implementation workflow
   - Structure: Ordered collection of WorkflowStep instances that define the complete workflow

### Algorithms

1. **Step Detection Algorithm**
   ```
   function determineNextStep(changeRequestPath):
       stepFilePath = generateStepFilePath(changeRequestPath)
       
       if fileExists(stepFilePath):
           try:
               state = loadState(stepFilePath)
               validateState(state)
               if state.CurrentStepIndex >= len(workflowSteps):
                   return WORKFLOW_COMPLETED
               return state.CurrentStepIndex
           catch InvalidStateError:
               logWarning("Invalid state file detected")
               return 0
       else:
           return 0
   ```

2. **Step Execution Algorithm**
   ```
   function executeStep(changeRequestPath, stepIndex):
       // Load the change request
       changeRequest = loadChangeRequest(changeRequestPath)
       
       // Get the current step
       currentStep = workflowSteps[stepIndex]
       
       // Generate output filename
       outputFile = generateOutputFilename(changeRequestPath, currentStep)
       
       // Execute the step (e.g., prompt the AI to perform the step)
       success = executeStepAction(changeRequest, currentStep, outputFile)
       
       if success:
           // Update state file
           updateStateFile(changeRequestPath, stepIndex + 1)
           return true
       else:
           return false
   ```

3. **State File Management Algorithm**
   ```
   function updateStateFile(changeRequestPath, newStepIndex):
       stepFilePath = generateStepFilePath(changeRequestPath)
       
       // Get existing state or create new one
       if fileExists(stepFilePath):
           state = loadState(stepFilePath)
       else:
           state = new WorkflowState()
           state.ChangeRequestPath = changeRequestPath
       
       // Update state
       state.CurrentStepIndex = newStepIndex
       state.LastModified = currentTime()
       state.CompletedSteps = workflowSteps[0:newStepIndex].map(step => step.ID)
       
       // Save state
       saveState(stepFilePath, state)
   ```

### Refactoring Strategy

1. **Command Structure Alignment**
   - Add a new `code.go` file in the `cmd` package following the existing command pattern
   - Ensure consistent error handling and user interface with other commands

2. **Workflow Management Module**
   - Create a new package `internal/workflow` to encapsulate workflow-related functionality
   - Move workflow state management and step execution logic into this package
   - Define clear interfaces for file system operations and terminal I/O to support testing

3. **User Interface Improvements**
   - Standardize success, warning, and error message formats across all commands
   - Ensure clear, actionable feedback is provided at each step
