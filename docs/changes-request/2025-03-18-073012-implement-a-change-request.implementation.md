# Implementation of the "implement" CLI Command

## Overview

In this change request, we implemented a new CLI command `implement` that allows users to select and implement change requests. The command identifies incomplete change requests (those with blueprint files but no implementation files) and guides the user through the implementation process.

## Implementation Details

### Core Functionality

1. Created a new `implement` command that:
   - Finds incomplete change requests (blueprint files without corresponding implementation files)
   - Displays appropriate messages based on the number of incomplete change requests found
   - Allows users to select a change request when multiple are available
   - Shows implementation instructions for the selected change request

2. Refactored common functionality to reduce code duplication:
   - Created a new `internal/changerequest` package with shared functions
   - Moved the change request finding logic to `FindIncomplete()`
   - Moved the formatting logic to `FormatDescription()`

### Command-Specific Messaging

- When no incomplete change requests are found, displays a message guiding the user to create a new change request
- When a change request is selected, displays instructions for implementation with a link to the blueprint file

### Tests

Implemented comprehensive tests for:
1. The shared functions in the `changerequest` package
2. The command-specific functionality in `implement.go`
3. Edge cases such as no change requests, directory not found, etc.

## Refactoring

During implementation, we identified duplicate logic between the new `implement` command and the existing `recap` command. To eliminate this duplication:

1. Created a new package `internal/changerequest`
2. Moved shared functions to this package:
   - `FindIncomplete` - Finds change requests with blueprints but no implementations
   - `FormatDescription` - Creates user-friendly descriptions for the selection menu

3. Updated both commands to use these shared functions
4. Updated all relevant test files to use the new package

This approach improved code maintainability by:
- Eliminating duplication
- Creating a single source of truth for finding and formatting change requests
- Making future changes easier to implement consistently

## Testing and Validation

All implemented code includes thorough tests covering:
- Core functionality
- Edge cases
- Error handling

The implementation successfully passed all test cases and integrates seamlessly with the existing `usm` CLI tool.
