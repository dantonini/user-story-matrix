# USM-CLI Setup Implementation Recap

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the User Story Matrix CLI (USM-CLI) setup phase based on the blueprint in `docs/changes-request/2025-03-17-084000-setup.blueprint.md`. All user stories and acceptance criteria from the setup requirements have been successfully implemented.

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Project Initialization

1. **Initialize USM-CLI Project**
   - Created GitHub repository structure with proper organization
   - Set up Go project with main.go as the entry point
   - Implemented basic CLI functionality with help command
   - Ensured the project follows Go best practices

2. **Define Project Directory Structure**
   - Implemented the required directory structure:
     ```
     ./ 
     ├── cmd/       # CLI commands 
     ├── internal/  # Internal packages 
     ├── main.go    # Entry point 
     ├── go.mod     # Module dependencies 
     ├── go.sum     # Dependency lock file 
     ├── README.md  # Documentation 
     ├── .gitignore # Git ignored files
     ```
   - Created .gitignore with common Go exclusions

3. **Set Up Dependency Management**
   - Initialized Go modules with `go mod init github.com/user-story-matrix/usm-cli`
   - Added required dependencies:
     - github.com/spf13/cobra v1.8.0 for command management
     - go.uber.org/zap v1.26.0 for logging
   - Documented dependency management in README.md
   - Created a Makefile target (`make deps`) to run `go mod tidy`

### Phase 2: Core CLI Structure

1. **Create Basic CLI Command Structure**
   - Implemented root command using cobra in `cmd/root.go`
   - Added `--help` functionality showing usage instructions
   - Created example command in `cmd/example.go` that prints "Hello, USM!"
   - Set up command structure for future extensions

2. **Implement Logging and Debugging Support**
   - Integrated zap logging library in `internal/logger/logger.go`
   - Added `--debug` flag for verbose output
   - Implemented error handling with clear messages
   - Set up log file output option
   - Created logger interface with Debug, Info, Warn, Error, and Fatal methods

3. **Set Up Unit Testing Framework**
   - Created initial test file `cmd/root_test.go`
   - Implemented sample tests for basic functionality
   - Set up Makefile with test target (`make test`)
   - Ensured tests run with `go test ./...`

### Phase 3: Distribution and Documentation

1. **Package and Distribute USM-CLI**
   - Set up build process for multiple platforms in Makefile:
     - Linux (amd64)
     - macOS (amd64)
     - Windows (amd64)
   - Implemented semantic versioning system (starting at 0.1.0)
   - Created installation scripts:
     - `install.sh` for Linux/macOS
     - `install.ps1` for Windows
   - Documented release process in RELEASE.md

2. **Create GitHub Actions for Automated Builds**
   - Set up workflow in `.github/workflows/build.yml`
   - Configured builds for all target platforms
   - Added test execution to the workflow
   - Configured triggers for main branch pushes and pull requests

3. **Create a README with Project Documentation**
   - Wrote comprehensive introduction to USM-CLI
   - Documented installation steps for all platforms
   - Included usage examples with command outputs
   - Added contribution guidelines
   - Added license information

4. **Installation Process**
   - Created simple installation methods for users
   - Documented installation in README.md
   - Created platform-specific installation scripts
   - Ensured installation places binary in accessible location

## Verification

The implementation was verified by:

1. Building the CLI with `make build`
2. Running the tests with `make test`
3. Testing the CLI with `./usm --help` and `./usm example`
4. Testing the debug mode with `./usm --debug example`
5. Building for all platforms with `make build-all`

All tests passed successfully, and the CLI is functioning as expected.

## Files Created

The following files were created during the implementation:

```
usm-cli/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── build.yml
├── cmd/
│   ├── example.go
│   ├── root.go
│   └── root_test.go
├── internal/
│   └── logger/

├── README.md
├── RELEASE.md
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── install.ps1

```

## Conclusion

All user stories and acceptance criteria from the setup phase have been successfully implemented. The USM-CLI now has a solid foundation for future development, with a well-structured codebase, proper documentation, and automated build and test processes.

The next phase will focus on implementing the core USM functionality, including matrix creation and manipulation, user story management, visualization features, and export capabilities.
