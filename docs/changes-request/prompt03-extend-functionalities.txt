Your task is **expand the implementation** to cover additional use cases, edge cases, and deferred features, as described in the blueprint.

- Read a set of user stories using the command: ./cat-user-stories-in-change-request.sh docs/changes-request/2025-03-24-200355-full-tui.code.md
- Read the implementation plan docs/changes-request/2025-03-24-200355-full-tui.code.md
- Read the "laying the foundation" accomplished summary using cat docs/changes-request/2025-03-24-200355-full-tui.code.md.accomplished.md
- Read the "MVI" accomplished summary using cat: docs/changes-request/2025-03-24-200355-full-tui.mvi.md.accomplished.md 

1. For each user story:
   - Review the acceptance criteria not yet implemented.
   - Identify edge cases and secondary scenarios.
   - Extend the implementation accordingly.

2. For each new case:
   - Add or update tests.
   - Ensure the verification logic (e.g., test assertions) remains aligned with the blueprint.

3. Run the full test suite and validate all tests pass.

At the end of your task write the summary of what you accomplished in docs/changes-request/2025-03-24-200355-full-tui.extend-functionalities.md.accomplished.md
