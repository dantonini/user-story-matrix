# Golangci-lint Integration - Implementation Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the golangci-lint integration implementation in the USM project. It covers the architecture, data structures, algorithms, and key design decisions made throughout the development process.

## Architecture Overview

The golangci-lint integration follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

1. **Lint Package** (`internal/lint/lint.go`)
   - Central package providing core linting functionality
   - Offers configuration management and command execution

2. **Configuration File** (`.golangci.yml`)
   - YAML-based configuration defining linter settings and options
   - Provides a minimal, non-intrusive baseline configuration

3. **Build System Integration** (`Makefile`)
   - Dedicated targets for various linting operations
   - Version-aware command generation

4. **Pre-commit Hook** (`hooks/pre-commit`)
   - Lightweight, non-blocking linting for git workflow
   - Fast subset of linters for immediate feedback

5. **Dead Code Management** (`scripts/lint-fix-deadcode.sh`)
   - Specialized tooling for dead code detection and removal
   - Includes backup and safety mechanisms

6. **CI/CD Integration** (GitHub Actions workflows)
   - Pipeline stages for lint-only, build-only, and lint+build operations
   - Artifact generation for lint reports

## Data Structures

### Lint Configuration (`Config` struct)

The `Config` struct in `internal/lint/lint.go` is the central data structure that encapsulates all linting configuration options:

```go
type Config struct {
    // EnabledLinters is a list of linters to enable
    EnabledLinters []string
    // DisableAll disables all linters before enabling specific ones
    DisableAll bool
    // Fast enables only fast linters
    Fast bool
    // Fix automatically fixes issues when possible
    Fix bool
    // ConfigFile specifies the path to a config file, empty means use default
    ConfigFile string
    // VerboseOutput enables more detailed output
    VerboseOutput bool
    // Paths defines specific file paths to lint (empty = all)
    Paths []string
    // SkipDirs lists directories to skip
    SkipDirs []string
    // Timeout sets the maximum execution time
    Timeout time.Duration
    // EnableCache enables caching for faster repeated runs
    EnableCache bool
    // OnlyNewIssues only reports new issues compared to the baseline
    OnlyNewIssues bool
    // TestFiles determines whether to include test files
    TestFiles bool
    // OutputFormat sets the output format
    OutputFormat string
    // Exclude specifies patterns to exclude
    Exclude []string
}
```

This structure provides a flexible and comprehensive way to configure all aspects of the linting process, from which linters to run to how output should be formatted.

### Configuration Presets

Multiple factory functions in `internal/lint/lint.go` provide specialized configurations for different use cases:

1. **DefaultConfig()** - Standard linting configuration with essential linters
2. **FastConfig()** - Optimized for speed with a minimal set of linters
3. **DeadCodeConfig()** - Focused on dead code detection
4. **CIConfig()** - Tailored for continuous integration environments
5. **TestConfig()** - Specialized for linting test files

### Version-aware Makefile Variables

The `Makefile` includes several variables for version detection and compatibility:

```makefile
GOLANGCI_VERSION := $(shell golangci-lint --version 2>/dev/null | grep -o 'version [0-9.]*' | sed 's/version //' || echo "0.0.0")
SUPPORTS_CACHE := $(shell echo "$(GOLANGCI_VERSION)" | awk -F. '{ if ($$1 > 1 || ($$1 == 1 && $$2 >= 54)) print "true"; else print "false"; }')
GO_VERSION := $(shell go version | grep -o 'go[0-9.]*' | sed 's/go//' || echo "0.0.0")
```

These variables enable adaptive behavior based on the installed toolchain versions.

## Algorithms

### Linter Execution (`Run` function)

The core algorithm for executing linters is implemented in the `Run` function in `internal/lint/lint.go`:

```go
func Run(cfg Config, paths ...string) (string, error) {
    // Check if golangci-lint is installed
    // Build command arguments based on configuration
    // Execute command and capture output
    // Return results
}
```

This function takes a `Config` struct and optional paths, constructs the appropriate command-line arguments, executes the linter, and returns the output and any error that occurred.

### Dead Code Detection and Removal

The dead code detection and removal algorithm is implemented in `scripts/lint-fix-deadcode.sh`:

1. **Version Detection**:
   - Determine installed golangci-lint version
   - Select appropriate linter (`deadcode` or `unused`)

2. **Issue Identification**:
   - Run the selected linter against the codebase
   - Parse output to identify unused elements

3. **Backup and Safety**:
   - Create timestamped backups of affected files
   - Provide an option to review changes before applying

4. **Fix Application**:
   - Apply fixes using golangci-lint's `--fix` flag
   - Verify changes were applied successfully

5. **Validation**:
   - Run tests to ensure changes didn't break functionality
   - Provide recovery instructions if issues are found

### Version-aware Linter Selection

The `getDeadCodeLinter` function implements a key algorithm for handling linter deprecation:

```go
func getDeadCodeLinter() string {
    version, err := GetLintVersion()
    if err != nil {
        return "deadcode" // Default fallback
    }
    
    // Parse version numbers
    // For version >= 1.49.0, use 'unused' instead of 'deadcode'
    // Otherwise use 'deadcode'
}
```

This algorithm ensures the appropriate linter is used based on the installed golangci-lint version, handling the transition from the deprecated `deadcode` linter to its replacement `unused`.

### Pre-commit Hook Optimization

The pre-commit hook in `hooks/pre-commit` includes an algorithm for efficient processing:

```
# Determine if we should use parallel processing
if [ "$FILE_COUNT" -gt "$MAX_FILES_FOR_PARALLEL" ]; then
    USE_PARALLEL=true
    # Process all files at once
else
    # Process files individually with detailed feedback
fi
```

This adaptive approach optimizes performance based on the number of changed files.

## Design Decisions

### Minimal, Non-intrusive Configuration

A key design decision was to create a minimal linting configuration that provides value without overwhelming developers with false positives or noise:

1. **Selective Linter Enablement**: Using `disable-all: true` in `.golangci.yml` and explicitly enabling only essential linters
2. **Focus on High-Value Checks**: Prioritizing error checking, suspicious constructs, and dead code detection
3. **Exclude Patterns for Test Files**: Reducing noise by tailoring rules differently for production and test code

### Version Compatibility Strategy

A significant design decision was to make the implementation resilient to different versions of golangci-lint:

1. **Dynamic Linter Selection**: Automatically switching between `deadcode` and `unused` based on golangci-lint version
2. **Cache Flag Management**: Conditionally using cache flags only on versions that support them
3. **Go Version Adaptation**: Selecting appropriate linters based on the Go compiler version

### Non-blocking Developer Experience

To maintain a positive developer experience, several design decisions prioritize workflow efficiency:

1. **Pre-commit Hook Design**: Making linting warnings informative but never blocking commits
2. **Fast Linter Subset**: Using only quick linters in pre-commit to maintain responsiveness
3. **Actionable Output**: Formatting warnings with clear instructions on how to fix issues

### Error Handling and Recovery

Robust error handling was a key design focus:

1. **Graceful Build Failures**: Allowing builds to continue despite lint errors in specific contexts
2. **Backup Strategy**: Creating timestamped backups before automated changes
3. **Test Verification**: Running tests after dead code removal to catch regressions
4. **Clear Recovery Instructions**: Providing explicit guidance when issues are detected

### Macro-based Build System

The implementation uses Makefile macros for consistency and maintainability:

```makefile
# Install golangci-lint if needed
define ensure_golangci_lint
	@if ! command -v golangci-lint &> /dev/null; then \
		echo "golangci-lint not found. Installing..."; \
		go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@v1.54.2; \
	fi
endef
```

This design decision reduces duplication and ensures consistent behavior across different targets.

## Testing Strategy

The implementation includes comprehensive test coverage across several dimensions:

1. **Configuration Validation**: Tests like `TestLintConfigContents` verify the configuration structure and content
2. **Command Execution**: Tests like `TestLintCommandWorks` ensure commands run successfully
3. **Version Handling**: Tests like `TestDeadcodeLinterDeprecationHandling` verify version-specific behavior
4. **Makefile Integration**: Tests like `TestLintCommand` and `TestBuildFullCommand` validate build system integration
5. **Specific Target Testing**: Dedicated tests for each Makefile target (`TestLintTestsTarget`, `TestLintCITarget`, etc.)

## Cross-cutting Concerns

### Performance Optimization

Performance considerations are addressed throughout the implementation:

1. **Caching Strategy**: Version-aware cache flags for faster repeated runs
2. **Parallel Processing**: Smart parallel execution in pre-commit hooks for large change sets
3. **Limited Scope Linting**: Running linters only on changed files when appropriate
4. **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts to prevent hanging processes

### Documentation

Documentation is treated as a first-class concern:

1. **README Updates**: Comprehensive "Code Quality" section in README.md
2. **Configuration Comments**: Extensive comments in `.golangci.yml` explaining rationale
3. **Shell Script Help**: Clear usage instructions and error messages in shell scripts
4. **Version Compatibility Notes**: Documentation of version dependencies and transitions

## Conclusion

The golangci-lint integration provides a robust, version-aware, and developer-friendly approach to code quality management in the USM project. By focusing on non-intrusiveness, compatibility, and developer experience, the implementation successfully balances code quality enforcement with development velocity.

Key achievements include:
- Flexible linting configurations for different contexts
