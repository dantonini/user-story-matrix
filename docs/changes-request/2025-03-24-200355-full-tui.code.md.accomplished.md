# Summary of Accomplishments for TUI Implementation

## 1. Created a POM (Page Object Model) Architecture
- Structured components in separate directories: models, components, styles, and pages.
- Created independent and testable UI components.
- Implemented a central state management approach.

## 2. Implemented Key Components
- **UIState**: Central state management for all UI components.
- **SearchBox**: Handles user input for search filtering.
- **StoryList**: Displays and manages the list of user stories.
- **StatusBar**: Shows contextual information and help.

## 3. Created the Main SelectionPage
- Integrates all components into a cohesive UI.
- Manages input handling and focus switching.
- Provides API for retrieving selected stories.

## 4. Created an Adapter for Integration
- Connects our new POM-based implementation to the existing code.
- Allows for smooth transition between old and new implementations.

## 5. Added Tests
- Comprehensive test coverage for the SelectionPage.
- Tests for filtering, selection, and focus behavior.

## 6. Created a Demo Application
- Showcases the selection page functionality.
- Provides a way to test the UI without modifying the main application.

This foundation follows the blueprint requirements for the user stories and sets the stage for the upcoming implementation of the full TUI functionality. The Page Object Model approach ensures better separation of concerns, improved testability, and easier maintenance, just as specified in the blueprint.
