# USM-CLI Setup Implementation Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the User Story Matrix CLI (USM-CLI) setup phase. The plan addresses all user stories and acceptance criteria from the setup requirements.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Initialization

1. **Initialize USM-CLI Project**
   - Create GitHub repository with proper structure
   - Set up Go project with initial main.go
   - Implement basic CLI functionality with help command
   - Ensure the project follows Go best practices

2. **Define Project Directory Structure**
   - Implement the required directory structure:
     ```
     usm-cli/ 
     ├── cmd/       # CLI commands 
     ├── internal/  # Internal packages 
     ├── main.go    # Entry point 
     ├── go.mod     # Module dependencies 
     ├── go.sum     # Dependency lock file 
     ├── README.md  # Documentation 
     ├── .gitignore # Git ignored files
     ```
   - Create .gitignore with common Go exclusions

3. **Set Up Dependency Management**
   - Initialize Go modules with `go mod init`
   - Add required dependencies (cobra, logging library)
   - Document dependency management in README

### Phase 2: Core CLI Structure

1. **Create Basic CLI Command Structure**
   - Implement root command using cobra
   - Add `--help` functionality
   - Create example command that prints "Hello, USM!"
   - Set up command structure for future extensions

2. **Implement Logging and Debugging Support**
   - Integrate logging library (zap recommended for performance)
   - Add `--debug` flag for verbose output
   - Implement error handling with clear messages
   - Set up log file output option

3. **Set Up Unit Testing Framework**
   - Create initial test files
   - Implement sample tests for basic functionality
   - Set up Makefile with test target
   - Ensure tests run with `go test ./...`

### Phase 3: Distribution and Documentation

1. **Package and Distribute USM-CLI**
   - Set up build process for multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - Implement semantic versioning system
   - Create installation scripts for each platform
   - Document release process in RELEASE.md

2. **Create GitHub Actions for Automated Builds**
   - Set up workflow in .github/workflows/build.yml
   - Configure builds for all target platforms
   - Add test execution to the workflow
   - Configure triggers for main branch pushes

3. **Create a README with Project Documentation**
   - Write comprehensive introduction to USM-CLI
   - Document installation steps for all platforms
   - Include usage examples with command outputs
   - Add contribution guidelines

4. **Installation Process**
   - Create simple installation methods for users
   - Document installation in README
   - Ensure installation places binary in accessible location
   - Test installation process on all platforms

## Success Criteria

The setup phase will be considered complete when:

1. All acceptance criteria from the user stories are met
2. The CLI can be built and run on all target platforms
3. Documentation is complete and accurate
4. Tests pass for all implemented functionality
5. GitHub Actions successfully build the project
6. Users can easily install and run the CLI

## Next Steps

After completing the setup phase, the project will move to implementing core USM functionality, including:

1. Matrix creation and manipulation
2. User story management
3. Visualization features
4. Export capabilities
