# Code Command Extension Accomplishments

## Enhanced User Feedback System
- Added structured message templates in `workflow.go` (`ErrFileNotFound`, `ErrInvalidStateFile`, `ErrUnrecognizedStep`, etc.) with clear naming conventions and consistent formatting
- Implemented comprehensive user feedback methods in `UserOutput` interface and its implementations:
  - `PrintWarning`: Added in `workflow.go:UserOutput` for non-critical issues
  - `PrintProgress`: Added in `workflow.go:UserOutput` for operation progress indicators
  - `PrintSuccess`: Added in `workflow.go:UserOutput` for successful operation notifications
- Enhanced error reporting with context-rich messages in:
  - `workflow.go:LoadState`: Added warning for corrupted state files
  - `executor.go:ExecuteStep`: Added specific error messages for file operations

## Workflow State Management Improvements
- Added validation in `workflow.go:LoadState` to verify `CurrentStepIndex` is within valid range
- Enhanced state reset logic in `workflow.go:LoadState` when corrupted states are detected
- Improved progress reporting in `workflow.go:SaveState` with `ProgressSavingState` messages
- Implemented success notifications in `workflow.go:DetermineNextStep` with `SuccessWorkflowCompleted`

## Test Coverage and Verification
- Added `TestWorkflowManager_LoadState_WithInvalidStepIndex` to verify step index validation logic
- Added `TestWorkflowManager_SaveState` to verify state persistence
- Added `TestWorkflowManager_DetermineNextStep_WorkflowComplete` to verify workflow completion detection
- Added `TestStepExecutor_ExecuteStep_FileSystemErrors` to verify error handling for file system operations
- Enhanced `TestStepExecutor_ExecuteStep` with detailed output verification

## Code Quality and Structure
- Improved error handling throughout with standardized error message formatting
- Enhanced mock implementations:
  - `MockIO`: Updated to support all `UserOutput` methods
  - `MockFileSystem`: Improved with better file operation simulation
- Standardized test methods with consistent naming and verification approaches

## Blind Spot Code
Based on test coverage report (78.6% coverage):
- `generateStepContent` (42.9% coverage): Limited testing of step-specific content generation
- `ExecuteStep` (77.8% coverage): Some edge cases in file handling not fully tested
- `IsWorkflowComplete` (75.0% coverage): Edge cases around error handling not covered
- Error cases in `SaveState` (77.8% coverage): Missing tests for JSON marshaling errors

## Acceptance Criteria Needing Further Work
1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The `generateStepContent` function has only 42.9% test coverage and should have more test cases for different step types
   - Need more comprehensive testing of failure scenarios in file operations

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - No performance benchmarks or optimizations were implemented for file operations
   - File reading/writing could be improved with buffering or streaming for larger files

3. **User Experience**:
   - The success/progress messaging could be enhanced with more context-specific information
   - No interactive prompts or confirmations were added for destructive operations (e.g., workflow reset)
