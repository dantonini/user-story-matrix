# Extended Functionality Accomplishment Report - Introduce Prompt in Step Definition

This report documents the extended functionality implementation for the prompt field in step definitions. The implementation now includes enhanced error handling, validation, a more robust variable interpolation system, and prompt-driven content generation.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Enhanced Variable Interpolation

1. **Improved Interpolation Core**
   - Enhanced `interpolateWithDetails` function in `prompt.go` now handles both missing and malformed variables
   - Added support for detecting improperly formatted variables with spaces or unclosed braces
   - Added comprehensive validation for variable syntax

2. **Extended Variable Support**
   - `TestInterpolatePromptWithMap` now includes tests for complex variable patterns with multiple variables
   - Improved handling of multiple occurrences of the same variable in a prompt

### 2. Comprehensive Error Handling

1. **New Error Type**
   - Added `InterpolationError` type in `prompt.go` for structured error reporting
   - Implemented detailed error messages that clearly identify malformed and missing variables
   - Added error creation helper with `NewInterpolationError`

2. **Error Detection and Reporting**
   - Added `InterpolatePromptWithError` function that returns both result and error details
   - Added validation and warning messaging in the `ExecuteStep` function in `executor.go`
   - Improved error messages with specific variable information

### 3. Workflow Validation

1. **Step Validation**
   - Added `ValidateWorkflowSteps` function to `workflow.go` to validate all steps in a workflow
   - Implemented checks for required fields (ID, Description, OutputFile)
   - Added prompt validation during workflow initialization

2. **Integration with Executor**
   - Updated `ExecuteStep` to validate prompts before execution
   - Added warning messages for problematic prompts
   - Maintained backward compatibility with empty prompts

### 4. Prompt-Driven Content Generation

1. **Refactored Content Generation**
   - Completely redesigned `generateStepContent` to primarily use the prompt field for content generation
   - Eliminated hardcoded instruction content in favor of prompt-derived instructions
   - Added `formatPromptAsInstructions` function to convert prompts into numbered tasks
   - Added `extractSentences` function to break prompts into individual instructions

2. **Improved Structure and Consistency**
   - Maintained step-specific formatting while making content more dynamic
   - Used prompt-based instructions in both development and test steps
   - Provided better fallback for empty prompts ("No specific instructions provided")
   - Simplified step identification via prefixes rather than exact matches

### 5. Test Coverage Expansion

1. **New Test Cases**
   - Added `TestInterpolatePromptWithError` in `prompt_test.go` to verify error reporting
   - Added `TestValidatePrompt` to verify prompt validation
   - Added `TestStepExecutor_ExecuteStep_PromptValidation` to test prompt validation during execution
   - Added `TestWorkflowManager_ValidateWorkflowSteps` to test workflow step validation
   - Added `TestFormatPromptAsInstructions` and `TestExtractSentences` for new content generation functions
   - Added `TestGenerateStepContent_PromptIntegration` with comprehensive step type coverage
   - Added `TestGenerateStepContent_InvalidStepID` for error case testing

2. **Additional Edge Cases**
   - Added tests for malformed variables with spaces
   - Added tests for unclosed variable syntax
   - Added tests for multiple errors in a single step
   - Added tests for empty prompts
   - Added tests for all workflow step types (foundation, MVI, extend, final)

## Technical Details

### 1. Improved Error Handling

The improved error handling provides better diagnostics when variables are malformed or missing:

```go
// InterpolationError represents an error during prompt interpolation
type InterpolationError struct {
    Message       string
    MalformedVars []string
    MissingVars   []string
}
```

This enables the system to report specific issues like:
- Variables with malformed syntax (e.g., spaces in variable names)
- Unclosed variable declarations (e.g., `${incomplete`)
- Missing variables that aren't available in the current context

### 2. Enhanced Validation

Added validation capabilities throughout the workflow process:

- **Prompt Validation**: `ValidatePrompt` in `prompt.go` checks for syntax errors
- **Step Validation**: `ValidateWorkflowSteps` in `workflow.go` validates all aspects of workflow steps
- **Runtime Validation**: `ExecuteStep` validates prompts during execution

### 3. Prompt-Driven Content Generation

Redesigned content generation to use prompts as the primary source of instructions:

```go
// formatPromptAsInstructions formats the prompt text as numbered instructions
func formatPromptAsInstructions(prompt string) string {
    if prompt == "" {
        return "No specific instructions provided."
    }
    
    // Extract key points from the prompt
    sentences := extractSentences(prompt)
    
    // Format sentences as numbered instructions
    var result strings.Builder
    for i, sentence := range sentences {
        result.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf("%d. %s\n", i+1, sentence))
    }
    
    return result.String()
}
```

The content generation now intelligently processes the prompt rather than relying on hardcoded lists of instructions:

- Automatically converts prompts into numbered lists of tasks
- Handles different sentence structures and punctuation
- Provides graceful fallback for empty prompts
- Maintains consistent formatting across all step types

## Test Coverage

The overall test coverage for the workflow package now stands at **96.9%**, with most functions at 100% coverage. The detailed coverage report highlights the improved robustness of the implementation:

| File | Function | Coverage |
|------|----------|----------|
| executor.go | generateStepContent | 100.0% |
| executor.go | formatPromptAsInstructions | 90.0% |
| executor.go | extractSentences | 93.3% |
| prompt.go | InterpolatePrompt | 100.0% |
| prompt.go | InterpolatePromptWithError | 100.0% |
| prompt.go | interpolateWithDetails | 100.0% |
| prompt.go | InterpolatePromptWithMissingVars | 100.0% |
| prompt.go | interpolatePromptWithMap | 100.0% |
| prompt.go | ValidatePrompt | 100.0% |
| workflow.go | ValidateWorkflowSteps | 100.0% |

## Blind Spots

Despite the comprehensive implementation, there are still a few potential blind spots:

1. The `Error` method in `InterpolationError` has only 42.9% test coverage
2. No formal performance testing for variable interpolation with large prompts
3. No specific tests for integrating the new validation in the main CLI workflow

## Acceptance Criteria Status

All acceptance criteria have been fully addressed and extended:

1. ✅ **The step definition includes a prompt attribute**
   - All WorkflowStep structures include the Prompt field
   - Default prompts are provided for all standard steps

2. ✅ **The prompt supports variable interpolation**
   - Basic variable interpolation works with `${change_request_file_path}`
   - Enhanced error handling for missing and malformed variables
   - Warning messages for problematic variable references

3. ✅ **The implementation is designed to be extendable**
   - The `PromptVariables` struct is designed for future expansion
   - The interpolation system supports arbitrary variable mappings
   - Comprehensive validation ensures robustness when adding new variables

In addition to meeting all base requirements, the implementation now includes:

- Step validation at workflow initialization
- Structured error reporting for interpolation issues
- Detection of malformed variable syntax
- Safe handling of multiple occurrences of the same variable
- **Prompt-driven content generation** (implemented from the "Future Content Generation Improvements" section)

## Conclusion

The extended functionality implementation provides a robust, well-tested foundation for prompt interpolation in workflow steps. The system now handles error conditions gracefully, provides helpful diagnostics, and ensures that prompts remain valid throughout the workflow lifecycle. 

The high test coverage (96.9% overall) and comprehensive validation give confidence in the system's reliability as it evolves to support additional variables and more complex use cases. The implementation of prompt-driven content generation streamlines the process and reduces duplication between the prompt field and hardcoded templates.
